# MM811 Assignment Report
Name: Xinyao Sun

## Description of Dataset
The dataset is generated from my [MM804 term projects](https://github.com/Lucklyric/Fall2015MM804Project/tree/For_Deep_Learning_MM811_AS3) matlab program. I added ["outputTrainningFile.m"](https://github.com/Lucklyric/Fall2015MM804Project/blob/For_Deep_Learning_MM811_AS3/MatLabScripts/outputTrainningFile.m) on brach "For MM811 AS3" to make it able to generate the datafile for this assignment.

Each line in the data set includes a set of hands spatial information read from a [Leaps Motion Sensor](https://www.leapmotion.com/) at one frame and is followed by the label (0 or 1) indicates if this sensor returns the most accurate pose estimation among a sensor array at this timestamp. 

In order to generate the datafile for this assignment

`````
git clone -b For_Deep_Learning_MM811_AS3 https://github.com/Lucklyric/Fall2015MM804Project.git
`````

Run the "outputTrainningFile.m" under "MatLabScripts" directory in your MatLab

## Deep Learning Problem
The high-level purpose is for multi-sensors hand motion data fusion to deal with the vision-based sensors' occlusion problem, you can link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0LsW1CrvC0RODNtNHFfdWdLcGM/view?usp=sharing) to read the report from my MM804 course project.( In previous work I used SVM to build the classifer. )

The low-level task for using the deep learning is that I want to have a classifier(pre-trained) to intelligently determine which sensor contributes the most accurate hand pose estimation based on a set of selected hands information(feature vector) read from a sensor array (two sensors here).

## Inputs of the model
Inputs of the model is a feature vector with 11 floating point value as follows:
* Three (X, Y, and Z) values of the palm position relative
to the sensor.
* Three (X, Y, and Z) values of the palm plane normal
relative to the sensor.
* Three (X, Y, and Z) values of the forward direction of
the hand.
* The dot product between the palm normal and the direction
the sensor is facing.
* Sensor confidence estimation. The value generated by
an internal proprietary algorithm of the Leap motion
API that is a floating number between 0 and 1.

## Output of the model
The output of the model is 0 or 1:
* 0: This sensor is classified as the sensor generate worse pose estimation
* 1: This sensor is classified as the sensor generate better pose estimation
